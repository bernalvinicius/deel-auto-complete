## Why?

This project is part of the Deel selection process. It is an auto-complete component made with ReactJS and TypeScript, without using any external library.

The project didn't make any imposition regarding the interface, so the layout developed with the best possible user experience.

## Some Observations about this App

**1** - As it wasn't possible to use any external library, everything was done in the most native way possible.

**2** - Using pure CSS styling, fetch for API access and Context for state management.

## Functionalities

- Home Page:
  - There is a country search input field available to the user. The search is only started when there are at least three characters typed in the field.
  - In order to provide a pleasant user experience, all use cases are handled. When there are API responses, the list of countries matching the search is displayed. During the search, the message "Loading..." is displayed. If the search is for a country that is not included in the database used, the message "No countries found" is displayed.
  - With this, the user has access to the information he needs with clarity and ease, providing a better use of the system.
